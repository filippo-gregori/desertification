# Desertification Analysis Tools

A collection of Python scripts for desertification and climate analysis using satellite and reanalysis data.

## Project Structure

### Data Acquisition
Tools for downloading climate and environmental data.

**Available downloaders:**
- **ERA5 Temperature Downloader**: Downloads daily maximum temperature data from ERA5-Land reanalysis

See [`data_acquisition/`](data_acquisition/) for detailed documentation and usage instructions.

### Data Analysis
Scripts and notebooks for analyzing climate data for desertification studies.

**Planned analysis tools:**
- Vegetation indices calculation (NDVI, EVI)
- Drought severity analysis  
- Climate trend analysis
- Desertification indicators

See [`data_analysis/`](data_analysis/) for analysis scripts and notebooks.
